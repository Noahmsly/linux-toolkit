We cannot easily recreate the issue with the provided information. Please add a **minimal** reproduction in order for us to be able to help more efficiently.

### Why was this issue marked with the `please simplify reproduction` label?

There was a reproduction provided, but due to its complexity, we cannot easily reproduce the issue.

An ideal minimal reproduction (_unless relevant_):

- is not part of a monorepo
- does not require secrets to run
- does not reference private registry dependencies
- has as few dependencies as possible
- excludes unrelated pages/routes
- does not require a database/third-party service to run
- only includes the code necessary to reproduce the issue

**In general, assume that we should not go through a lengthy onboarding process at your company code only to be able to verify an issue.**

### What happens if I don't provide a sufficient minimal reproduction?

Issues with the `please simplify reproduction` label that receive no meaningful activity (e.g. new comments with a simplified reproduction link) are automatically closed and locked after **14** days.

If your issue has _not_ been resolved in that time and it has been closed/locked, please open a new issue with the required reproduction.

### I did not open this issue, but it is relevant to me, what can I do to help?

Anyone experiencing the same issue is welcome to provide a minimal reproduction following the above steps.

### I think my reproduction is good enough, why aren't you looking into it quicker?

We look into every Next.js issue and constantly monitor open issues for new comments.
